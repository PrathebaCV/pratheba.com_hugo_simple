Pratheba Chandramohan builds in many dimensions—with ink, pixels, and dreams. 
              Trained as a structural engineer at Sri Krishna College of Technology, Coimbatore and Civil Engineering at GCE Salem, 
              she carries an innate sense of balance into everything she creates—whether it’s designing the bones of a building, shaping the framework of a website, or sketching the first curve of a painting.    
              By day, she’s a web developer and artist who finds beauty in both the logic of code and 
              the unpredictability of brushstrokes. By night, she is a storyteller, 
              weaving tales where memory, emotion, and imagination converge. 
              And always, she is a mother—a role that sharpens her empathy, 
              deepens her patience, and fuels her commitment to creating art that outlives her.
              Her worlds—whether on canvas, in prose, or on screen—are crafted to make you pause, linger, and feel.
